        <p>Jorasanko Thakur Bari (Bengali: House of the Thakurs (anglicised to Tagore)) in Jorasanko, North Kolkata, West Bengal, India, is the ancestral home of the Tagore family. It is currently located on the Rabindra Bharati University campus at 6/4 Dwarakanath Tagore Lane,[1]
             Jorasanko, Kolkata 700007.[2] It is the house in which the poet and first non-European Nobel laureate in Literature, Rabindranath Tagore was born. It is also the place where he spent most of his childhood and died on 7 August 1941.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <br>
        <p>It was built in the 18th century on the land donated by the famous Sett family of burrabazar to ‘Prince’ Dwarkanath Tagore (Rabindranath Tagore's grandfather). Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) was born here.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Tagore Museum</h2>
        <br>
        <p>The house has been restored to reflect the way the household looked when the Tagore family lived in it and currently serves as the Tagore museum for Kolkata. It offers details about the history of the Tagore family including its involvement with the Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Visits and programmes</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Apart from the heritage routine, Rabindra Bharati University organizes regular cultural programmes on the poet’s birthday, Panchise Baisakh, when thousands flock to Jorasanko Thakur Bari,[5][6] and on other occasions, such as his death anniversary, Baishe Shravan.[7] It also organises a festival of arts, Aban Mela.</p>
